Description Using IntelliJ Idea, this project was created in Java. This project was created for a university lab. Even though I anticipate that only my teacher will view this project, the README is still crucial. I had ten issues, and this code has eleven filesâ€”eleven for the main and ten for each issue.


Contributing There could be flaws, however it also offers solutions to all of these issues. With the exception of 1-4, I only use the main function to call the functions. For simpler code, I call each method from the main file. I added some explanations in the form of comments to the code.
